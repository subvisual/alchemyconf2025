While GenServers are invaluable for synchronizing data streams, they can become bottlenecks if not managed properly. Testing such systems adds another layer of complexity, often requiring extensive setup to test individual modules. This talk explores these challenges in depth, sharing real-world examples and practical solutions to streamline development and testing in such intricate systems.",
